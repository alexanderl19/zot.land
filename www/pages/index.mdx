title: zot.land
---

Taking inspiration from the great [js.org][js-org] project we at
@denosaurs thought of giving something back to the deno community: a free and
sleek URL where you can host a free website for your deno project.

## Table of Contents

## How to get one?

Pretty simple.

### Step 1 - Create and statically host a website

Find a static site hosting service (we recommend
[GitHub Pages][gh-pages]) and create your site.
If you need some inspiration, this site is built and hosted with GitHub Pages
and deployed with GitHub Actions.

### Step 2 - Choose your subdomain

Now you should determine your zot.land subdomain: either choose your username
or the name of your repository, according to the existing GitHub Pages URL
(for http://foo.github.io/bar, either "foo.zot.land" or "bar.zot.land" would
be possible).

### Step 3 - Add a CNAME to your repo

Add a file named "CNAME" to your root directory of your repository (or in the
"gh-pages" branch, if you use that) with a single line matching the domain you
have chosen (e.g. "foo.zot.land" without quotes). For more info about this step
you can follow the [Custom URLs][gh-custom-urls] section at GitHub Pages Help.

```diff:your-repo/CNAME
+ foo.zot.land
```

### Step 4 - Claim your subdomain

To finish the procedure, make a pull request in our [GitHub repository][repo]
that adds your subdomain to the list of existing zot.land domains. Your
new URL should go live within 24 hours (keep an eye on your pull request in
case of a naming conflict or a question from our side).

```diff:zot.land/cnames.ts
import { CNAMEs } from "./mod/types.ts";

export default <CNAMEs> {
  "@": {
    target: "alexanderl19.github.io/zot.land",
  },
+ "foo": {
+   target: "foo.github.io/bar",
+ }
};
```

## For advanced users

Our subdomain are _CNAME_ records which map one domain name to another. You can
actually point your zot.land to many different services like [Vercel][vercel]
or [Netlify][netlify].

## Important

As the owner of the repository, you keep complete control over your published
content. That also means that all rights and duties that come along with
publishing a GitHub Page (e.g. GDPR) remain in your responsibility.
