## Table of Content

## Subdomain determination

to make a pull request you have to determine a valid subdomain for your GitHub
Page in advance.

### User / Organization Page

if your GitHub URL looks like "foo.github.io" you should request the subdomain
"foo"

### Project Page

for a GitHub URL like "foo.github.io/bar", the subdomains "foo" or "bar" are
possible

### Exceptions

The requested subdomain should match your username or the name of your project
as close as possible; but exceptions are possible for the sake of clarity, e.g.:

- "foojs" > "foo"
- "foo42" > "foo"
- "Foo" > "foo"
- "foo-lib" > "foo"

### Organization repository mapping

If a subdomain maps to a GitHub or GitLab organization,

```javascript
'organization': 'organization.git[hub|lab].io',
```

all repositories of this organization that have published git pages will also
be mapped to zot.land.

If the git page of a repository is reachable at
https://organization.git[hub|lab].io/repository before switching,
https://organization.zot.land/repository will be reachable after the switch.

As long as the organization page has a CNAME file,
the repositories do not need separate CNAME settings for this to work.

## Naming Conflicts

A naming conflict happens when two or more users request the same subdomain
(because GitHub usernames are unique, this only happens with identical named
repositories or if a repository name coincides a username)

In case of a naming conflict, the parties should try to come to a
**conciliation first**. If the conflict persists the subdomain will be given to
the owner of the repository with the most valuable page. GitHub stars (or
follower in case of a User-/Organization Page) will be used as measurement.

To give some reliability and an adequate perspective to the holders of
subdomains, a reassignment will take place not before 3 months after the naming
conflict appeared the first time and will not recur within 3 months after that.

**To be on the safe side with your subdomain you should not request one for a
personal fork of a prominent project such as "jquery" or "angular".**

## No Content

Before zot.land can accept a pull request there has to be "reasonable content" on
the page (as stated in step 1 of the readme!). There has to be at least an
`index.html` with some texts, links, images,...

You should give anybody a clear picture what your page is (or will be) about.

This rule only exists to avoid name grabbing where people reserve one or more
subdomains for later use but never put any content on the page. JS.ORG doesn't
support this misbehavior.
